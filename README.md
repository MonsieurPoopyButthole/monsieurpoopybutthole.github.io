    This is my personal site  
    It is obviosuly a work in progress that will get updated  
    whenever I'm not lazy to do it.


    
    To my ✨Pookiebear D✨, in warmth so true,
    In yesteryears' style, my heart's song anew.
    Through timeless ages, love's echo, so rare,
    In whispers soft, I vow my care.
    Ever thine, through days and nights so fair.
